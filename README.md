## Description:
Project Adventure was a project that I was working on for my Computer Programming I class.  It is a game that  works like rock paper scissors.  Each boss will have a weakness to each weapon: Drill, Gauntlet, and Sword.  So far, it is more text than visual, however, I plan to make it into either a 2D-3D game or a 2d 8-bit game.
